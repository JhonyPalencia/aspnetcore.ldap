Authenticate Active Directory users with asp.net core

The main goal of this project is to show how to use Active Directory authetication in an ASP.NET Core web app, using the Novell.Directory.Ldap.NETStandard library to communicate with AD.
Based on David Liang response in this thread: [https://stackoverflow.com/a/50141578/4798452]

Right now it only Authenticates against AD. The next step is the implementation of policies to authorize different roles.
